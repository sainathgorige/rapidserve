[0;31mThis one looks easy to fix. It seems that there is a value started[0m
[0;31mwith a quote, and the YAML parser is expecting to see the line ended[0m
[0;31mwith the same kind of quote. For instance:[0m
[0;31m[0m
[0;31m    when: "ok" in result.stdout[0m
[0;31m[0m
[0;31mCould be written as:[0m
[0;31m[0m
[0;31m   when: '"ok" in result.stdout'[0m
[0;31m[0m
[0;31mOr equivalently:[0m
[0;31m[0m
[0;31m   when: "'ok' in result.stdout"[0m
[0;31mWe could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with[0m
[0;31munbalanced quotes. If starting a value with a quote, make sure the[0m
[0;31mline ends with the same set of quotes. For instance this arbitrary[0m
[0;31mexample:[0m
[0;31m[0m
[0;31m    foo: "bad" "wolf"[0m
